var quotes=['When ONTD was created, like other LiveJournal communities, it was operated exclusively by volunteer moderators.',
'LiveJournal was not involved in the day-to-day operation of the site.',
'ONTD, however, grew in popularity to 52 million page views per month in 2010 and attracted LiveJournal\'s attention.',
'By a significant margin, ONTD is LiveJournal\'s most popular community and is the only community with a \'household name.\'',
'In 2010, LiveJournal sought to exercise more control over ONTD so that it could generate advertising revenue from the popular community.',
'LiveJournal hired a then active moderator, Brendan Delzer, to serve as the communityâ€™s full time \'primary leader.\'',
'By hiring Delzer, LiveJournal intended to \'take over\' ONTD, grow the site, and run ads on it.'
